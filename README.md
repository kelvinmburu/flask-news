## Project Setup and Installation

1. Proceed to this [link](https://github.com/kelvinmburu/flask-news) and clone the repository.
2. Extract the folder and `cd` to the folder on your terminal or your prefered IDE
3. In the terminal, create a virtual/flask environment: `python3 -m venv virtual` and activate it through `source virtual/bin/activate`. In the case of flask, please use `source flask/bin/activate`.
4. Install all dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file; use `pip` to install needed dependencies.
5. In the project folder, create a `start.sh` file which acts as a server at runtime.
6. In the terminal, and within the project folder, run `chmod +x start.sh` and `./start.sh` to start the project.
7. View the application on your browser on `http://127.0.0.1:5000`. If you have another project running on another port, use `flask run --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5001` to switch to a new port; You can use a different port number.

## Behavior Driven Development (BDD)

The BDD focuses on how a user interacts with the application.

At a minimum, this is what the user should experience in the application:

* Main landing page with a list of articles from different authors and sources.
* By using the navbar, the user can navigate to different articles from different domains such as health or business.
* By using the search from on the navbar, the user can search for their favorite article.
* If a user clicks on a particular article link, they are redirected to the article's page where they can read it.
* Navigating to a different news section such as `Kenya` allows a user to read articles from that particular country.
